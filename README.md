The purpose of this repo is to document several rpg game designs so they could be implemented by various engines.  

Situation:  
* When learning a new programming language, it's common to see a 'hello world' example. This is a nice short and simple way to illustrate the most basic of a language's syntax and often serves as a point of comparison.  
* When trying to create a new video game in a new language or framework, there's a handful of simple games like pong, snake, breakout, pac-man, etc, that are often used to illustrate simple games.  
* There are few, if any, simple rpg game designs that could be implemented in different languages or frameworks.  
* There may be a benefit in having freely available game designs that could be implemented in a variety of ways that could provide a simple way to compare and contrast different frameworks or languages (or programming paradigms).

Target:  
* Simple designs for very small rpg games
* Example art and music assets
* Clear game design documents outlining the overall look and feel of the game
* Examples of implementations
* Cover a variety of rpg sub-types
* The goal is to completely eliminate spending energy on coming up with the actual Design
  * That is, game designers can instead focus 100% on actual implementation for their chosen framework/platform/language
  * The corollary here is, the design documents must strive to be framework/platform/language agnostic 
 
Proposal:
* Create a design document for games for the following rpg archetypes (example game)
  * JRPG (Dragon Warrior)
  * Zelda (A Link to the Past)
  * ARGP (Diablo)
  * Colony Sim (Dwarf Fortress)
  * roguelike (dungeon crawl: stone soup)
  * crafting (terraria)
* Completely define all characters, monster, stats, items, spells, locations, etc
  * The idea here is, game designers must be able to just reference the data and implement it
  * framework/platform/language specific data should not be included
